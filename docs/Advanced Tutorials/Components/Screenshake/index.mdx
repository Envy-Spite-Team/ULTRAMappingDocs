* Amount - The intensity of the screenshake. The range is from 1 to 3:
-  1 - small;
-  2 - normal;
-  3 - big.

* One Time - Activates the screenshake only one time.

* Continuous - Makes the screenshake work continuously. That means the component will always work when activated. In order to stop the screenshake simply deactivate the gameobject it is located in or disable it from [Object Activator](../../Tutorials/Object%20Activator/). It is recommended to use this.

:::warning
If enabled, screenshake will work as long as the gameobject it's put into is enabled.
:::

* Min/Max Distance - Designates a range where the screenshake will work (i.e. how close the player needs to be to the gameobject with the screenshake component in order to experience it.)

# How to use

To use the screenshake component, simply apply it on a gameobject, disable it, and later enable it via an object activator.

That's it.
