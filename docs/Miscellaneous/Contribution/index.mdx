Useful Resources:
- [Docusaurus Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/)
  - Because this documentation was made with Docusaurus, you might need to know some details of it.
- [MDX Documentation](https://mdxjs.com/docs/)
  - This documentation website uses Docusaurus. Because of that, documents are parsed using MDX and must follow JSX formatting.

# Creating a document

First, create a folder with the name of your document. In there create: `index.mdx` and `assets` folder. `index.mdx` is the file of your document, while `assets` folder is for images, files, etc.

At the start of `index.mdx`, make sure to specify the name of the document with a position if needed. This is required for the document to properly show up in the sidebar.

When dividing the document into chapters, please use `# Chapter name`.

You can read the basics of MDX [here](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/)

# Example

Here is the example of an `index.mdx` file. You can find this file in the root directory of the project.

```mdx
---
title: "Document Name Here"
position: "Document Position Here" 
---
{/* The document position affects on how its displayed in the sidebar. 1 being the top */}

# Document Name

Intro information.

This document can be found in the repositories files in `ExampleDocument.mdx` in the root directory.

# Section 1

{/*JSX is used for more complex stuff. It looks like HTML and contains tags from it but is different.*/}

{/*Image example*/}
<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
	<img src={require('./assets/ExampleImage.png').default} alt="Example Image"></img>
</div>

<h1>Heading!</h1>

<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a lovely language.

<section>
  And here is *markdown* in **JSX**!
</section>

{/*Some tags from HTML*/}
<ul>
    <li>1</li>
    <ul>
        <li>1.1</li>
        <li>1.2</li>
    </ul>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>3</li>
    <li>4</li>
    <li>5</li>
</ul>

{/* MDX also supports javascript expressions */}

{(function () {
  const guess = Math.random()

  if (guess > 0.66) {
    return <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>Look at us.</span>
  }

  if (guess > 0.33) {
    return <span style={{color: 'violet'}}>Who would have guessed?!</span>
  }

  return <span style={{color: 'goldenrod'}}>Not me.</span>
})()}

{/* MDX and imports with exports */}
import {External} from './some/place.js'

export const Local = properties => <span style={{color: 'red'}} {...properties} />

An <External>external</External> component and a <Local>local one</Local>.
