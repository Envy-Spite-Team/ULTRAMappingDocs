# Geometry

In this document, you will learn how to create good geometry for your levels using probuilder, how to properly tag them and how to create good arenas.

## Creating geometry

In your level editor there are preinstalled tools named **ProBuilder** and **ProGrids**. They are powerful tools for creating advanced geometry without a need to use external programs. At first, they can be very confusing to learn. So it is highly recommended to watch this YouTube tutorial made by Brackeys to learn how to use them.

:::note
If you are familiar with Blender, then you can build geometry in there, and then import it into Unity. Blender provides more tools for creating geometry than ProBuilder.
